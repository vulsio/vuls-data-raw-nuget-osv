	"summary": "DSInternals Credential Roaming Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability",
	"details": "### Impact\n\nA vulnerability exists in the `DSInternals.Common.Data.RoamedCredential.Save()` method, which incorrectly parses the `msPKIAccountCredentials` LDAP attribute values. As a consequence, a malicious actor would be able to modify the file system of the computer where an application using this function is executed with administrative privileges.\n\nA [similar security issue](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2022-30170) used to be present in the Windows operating system, as DSInternals re-implements the Credential Roaming feature of Windows.\n\n### Exploitability\n\nThe vulnerability can be exploited under the following circumstances:\n- An attacker is able to modify the `msPKIAccountCredentials` attribute of a user account in Active Directory. This attribute is used by the Credential Roaming feature of Windows and each AD user can modify their own roamed credentials. AND\n- A 3rd party application uses the `DSInternals.Common` library to export roamed credentials from Active Directory to a file system. AND\n- The application has administrative privileges on the local system.\n\nThe probability of any 3rd-party product using the `DSInternals.Common` library being affected by this vulnerability is extremely low.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue had been fixed in DSInternals 4.8.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt29-windows-credential-roaming\n",
